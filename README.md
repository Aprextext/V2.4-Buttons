# V2.4-Buttons
Modified from the legacy printers buttons by meteyou, I have created buttons which can be placed anywhere on a V2.4 skirt (may also fit trident/1.8, will confirm in later version).
There are 2 versions of the mount, one for flat mounting, and one for the base with a curve.
They all print in place with a nut to fix in place, which will be stiff as they come off the printer. Use the nut breaking tool in the rear of the button, whilst gripping the nut.
The buttons to be used are 12mm x 12mm tactile buttons, with the square mounting post. 
Ensure:
A) They are the THT versions, and flatten the leads.
B) That they come with the button mounting post...
